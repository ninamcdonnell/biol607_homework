& + \P(\textrm{both } A_1 A_1 | \text{2 alleles IBD}) r_2 \label{eqn:initial_relly_IBD_calc}
\end{align}
If our pair of relatives share $0$ alleles IBD, then the probability that
they are both homozygous is $\P(\textrm{both } A_1 A_1 |
\text{0 alleles IBD}) =p^2 \times p^2$, as all four alleles
represent independent draws from the population. If they share $1$
allele IBD, then the shared allele is of type $A_1$ with probability $p$, and then
the other non-IBD allele, in both relatives, also needs
to be $A_1$ which happens with probability $p^2$, so $\P(\textrm{both } A_1 A_1 |
\text{1 alleles IBD})=p \times p^2$. Finally, our pair of relatives can
share two alleles IBD, in which case $\P(\textrm{both } A_1 A_1 | \text{2 alleles IBD})
= p^2$, because if one of our individuals is homozygous for the $A_1$ allele,
both individuals will be. Putting this all together our \eqn
\eqref{eqn:initial_relly_IBD_calc} becomes
\begin{equation}
\P(\textrm{both } A_1 A_1) = p^4 r_0 + p^3 r_1 + p^2 r_2 \label{eqn:IBD_relly_calc}
\end{equation}
Note that for specific cases we could also calculate this by summing over all the
possible genotypes their shared ancestor(s) had; however, that would be much more
involved and not as general as the form we have derived here.
We can write out terms like \eqn \eqref{eqn:IBD_relly_calc} for all of
the possible configurations of genotype
sharing/non-sharing between a pair of individuals. Based on this we can write down the expected number of
polymorphic sites where our individuals are observed to share 0, 1, or 2
alleles.

There's a variety of ways to estimate the relationships among
individuals using genetic data.  An example of using allele sharing to identify relatives is offered by
the work of Nancy Chen \citep[in collaboration with Stepfanie
Aguillon, see ][]{chen:16,Aguillon:17}. \citeauthor{chen:16} has collected genotyping data from thousands of
Florida Scrub Jays at over ten thousand loci. These Jays live at the
Archbold field site, and have been carefully monitored for many
decades allowing the pedigree of many of the birds to be known.
Using these data, she estimates allele frequencies at each
locus. Then by equating the observed number of times that a pair of
individuals share $0$, $1$, or $2$ alleles to the theoretical
expectation, she estimates the probability of $r_0$, $r_1$, and
$r_2$ for each pair of birds. A plot of these are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:FSJ_IBD}, showing how well the estimates match those known
from the pedigree.

\end{figure}
We can more directly see the sharing of the genome among close
relatives using high-density SNP genotyping arrays. In Figure
\ref{fig:first_cousin_IBD} we show a simulation of first cousins'
genomic sharin from their shared grandmother. Colored purple are
regions where they have matching genomic material, due to having
inherited it IBD from their shared grandmother.
%JRI: text says ``Below'' but float ends up above
First cousins will share at least one allele of your genotype at all of the polymorphic loci in these purple regions. There's a range of methods to detect such sharing. One way is to look for unusually long stretches of the genome where two individuals are never homozygous for different alleles. By identifying pairs of individuals who share an unusually large number of such putative IBD blocks, we can hope to identify unknown relatives in genotyping datasets. In fact, companies like 23\&me and Ancestry.com use signals of IBD to help identify family ties.
As another example, consider the case of third cousins. You share one of eight sets of great-great-grandparents with each of your (likely many) third cousins. On average, you and each of your third cousins each inherit one-sixteenth of your genome from each of those two great-great-grandparents. This turns out to imply that on average, a little less than one percent of your and your third cousin's genomes ($2 \times (1/16)^2 =0.78\%$) will be identical by virtue of descent from those shared ancestors. A simulated example where third cousins share blocks of their genome (on chromosome 16 and 2) due to their great-great-grandmother is shown in Figure \ref{fig:third_cousin_IBD}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width= \textwidth]{figures/sharing_relatives/Third_cousin_overlap_1.png}
\end{center}
\caption[]{A simulation of sharing between third cousins, the details are the same as in Figure \ref{fig:first_cousin_IBD}.} \label{fig:third_cousin_IBD}
\end{figure}
Note how if you compare Figure \ref{fig:third_cousin_IBD} and Figure \ref{fig:first_cousin_IBD}, individuals inherit less IBD from a shared great-great-grandmother than from a shared grandmother, as they inherit from more total ancestors further back. Also notice how the sharing occurs in shorter genomic blocks, as it has passed through more generations of recombination during meiosis. These blocks are still detectable, and so third cousins can be detected using high-density genotyping chips, allowing more distant relatives to be identified than single marker methods alone. \sidenote{Indeed the suspect in case of the Golden State Killer was identified through identifying third cousins that genetically matched a DNA sample from an old crime scene (see \href{https://gcbias.org/2018/05/07/how-lucky-was-the-genetic-investigation-in-the-golden-state-killer-case/}{here} for more details).} More distant relations than third cousins, e.g. fourth cousins, start to have a significant probability of sharing none of their genome IBD. But you have many fourth cousins, so you will share some of your genome IBD with some of them; however, it gets increasingly hard to identify the degree of relatedness from genetic data the deeper in the family tree this sharing goes.
\subsection{Inbreeding}
We can define an inbred individual as an individual whose parents are
more closely related to each other than two random individuals drawn
from some reference population.  \\
\begin{marginfigure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width= \textwidth]{figures/Child_first_cousins_Homozy_BD.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Alleles being transmitted through an inbred pedigree. The two sisters (mum and aunt) share two alleles identical by descent (IBD). The cousins share one
allele IBD. The offspring of first cousins is homozygous by
descent at this locus.} \label{fig:IBD_cousins_cartoon}
\end{marginfigure}
\graham{Change this to have squares and circles}
When two related individuals produce an offspring, that individual can
receive two alleles that are identical by descent, i.e.\ they
can be homozygous by descent (sometimes termed autozygous), due to the
fact that they have two copies of an allele through different paths
through the pedigree.  This increased likelihood of being homozygous
relative to an outbred individual is the most obvious effect of
inbreeding. It is also the one that will be of most interest to us, as it
underlies a lot of our ideas about inbreeding depression and
population structure. For example, in Figure \ref{fig:IBD_cousins_cartoon} our
offspring of first cousins is homozygous by descent having received
the same IBD allele via two different routes around an inbreeding loop.\\
As the offspring receives a random allele from each parent ($i$ and $j$), the
probability that those two alleles are identical by descent is equal to the
kinship coefficient $F_{ij}$ of the two parents (\eqn \ref{eqn:coeffkinship}). This follows from the fact that
the genotype of the offspring is made by sampling an allele at random from each
of our parents. % We will use IBD for identical by descent. \\ %% this was already defined above.
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
$f_{11}$ & $f_{12}$ & $f_{22}$ \\
\hline
$(1-F) p^2 + F p$ & $(1-F) 2pq$ & $(1-F) q^2 + F q$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\textbf{Generalized Hardy--Weinberg}.  Dropped the indices $i$ and $j$ for simplicity. } \label{table:GeneralizedHWE}
\end{table}
The only way the offspring can be heterozygous ($A_1 A_2$) is if their two
alleles at a locus are not IBD (otherwise they would necessarily be
homozygous). Therefore, the probability that they are heterozygous is
\begin{equation}
\P(A_1 A_2) = \P(A_1 A_2 |\textrm{I \& J not IBD} ) \P (\textrm{I \& J not IBD} ) = 2p q (1-F_{ij}) ,
\label{eq:hetGenHW}
\end{equation}
%
The offspring
can be homozygous for the $A_1$ allele in two different ways.  They can have
two non-IBD alleles that are not IBD but happen to be of the allelic type
$A_1$, or their two alleles can be IBD, such that they inherited allele $A_1$
by two different routes from the same ancestor. Thus, the probability that an
offspring is homozygous for $A_1$ is
\begin{align}
P(A_1 A_1) & = \P(A_1 A_1 |\textrm{I \& J not IBD} ) \P (\textrm{I\&J
not IBD} ) + \P(A_1 A_1 |\textrm{I\&J IBD} ) \P (\textrm{I\&J IBD}) \nonumber\\
&= p^2(1-F_{ij})  + pF_{ij}.
\end{align}
%
using the Law of Total Probability (see Appendix
\eqn \eqref{eqn:law_tot_prob}).  Therefore, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes can be written as given in
Table \ref{table:GeneralizedHWE}, which provides a generalization of the Hardy--Weinberg
proportions.\\
%Note that the generalized Hardy--Weinberg proportions completely
%specify the genotype probabilities, as there are two parameters ($p$ and $F$)
%and two degrees of freedom (as $p$ and $q$ have to sum to one).
%Therefore, any combination of genotype frequencies at a biallelic site
%can be specified by a combination of $p$ and $F$.\\
%JRI: unclear to me if this is useful. will readers understand parameter numbers/DF?
\begin{question}{}
The frequency of the $A_1$ allele is $p$ at a biallelic locus. Assume that our population is randomly mating and that the
genotype frequencies in the population follow from HW. We select two
individuals at random to mate from this population. We then mate the children
from this cross. What is the probability that the child from this full
sib-mating is
homozygous?
\end{question}
\paragraph{Multiple inbreeding loops in a pedigree.}
Up to this point we have assumed that there is at most one inbreeding loop in the recent family history of our
individuals, i.e. the parents of our inbred individual have at most one recent genealogical connection. However, an individual who has multiple inbreeding loops in their pedigree can be homozygous by
descent thanks to receiving IBD alleles via multiple different different loops. To calculate inbreeding in pedigrees of arbitrary complexity, we can extend
beyond our original relatedness coefficients $r_0$, $r_1$, and $r_2$ to account for
higher order sharing of alleles IBD among relatives. For example,
we can ask, what is the probability that \textit{both} of the alleles in the first individual
are shared IBD with one allele in the second individual? There are
nine possible relatedness coefficients in total to completely describe kinship between two diploid individuals, and we won't go in to them here
as it's a lot to keep track of.
However, we will show how we can calculate the inbreeding coefficient of an
individual with multiple inbreeding loops more directly.\\
%ut at loci where the ancestor is inbred you get two more options (C inherits maternal/B paternal or opp.) so the factor of 2 applies to fA as well and cancels out for both.}
Let's say the parents of our inbred individual (B and C) have $K$ shared ancestors,
i.e. individuals who appear in both B and C's recent family trees. We denote these shared ancestors by $A_1, \dots,A_K$, and we denote by $n$ the total number of individuals in the chain from B to C via ancestor $A_i$, including B, C, and $A_i$. For example, if B is C's aunt, then B and C share two ancestors, which are B's parents and, equivalently, C's grandparents. In this case, there are n=4 individuals from B to C through each of these two shared ancestor. In the general case, the kinship coefficient of B and C,
i.e. the inbreeding coefficient of their child, is
\begin{equation}
F = \sum_{i=1}^K \frac{1}{2^{n_i}} \big( 1+ f_{A_i} \big) \label{eqn:inbreeding_over_ancs}
\end{equation}
where $f_{A_i}$ is the inbreeding coefficient of the ancestor
$A_i$. What's happening here is that we sum over all the mutually-exclusive paths in the pedigree through which B and C can share an allele IBD. With probability
$\nicefrac{1}{2^{n_i}}$, a pair of alleles picked at random from B and C is descended from the same ancestral allele in individual
$A_i$, in which case the alleles are IBD. \sidenote{For example, in the case of our aunt-nephew case, assuming that the aunt's two parents are their only recent shared ancestors, then $F = \nicefrac{1}{2^4}+\nicefrac{1}{2^4} = \nicefrac{1}{8}$, in agreement with the answer we would obtain from  \eqn \eqref{eqn:coeffkinship}.} However, even if B inherits the maternal allele and C inherits the paternal allele of shared ancestor $A_i$, if $A_i$ was
themselves inbred,  with probability $f_{A_i}$ those two
alleles are themselves IBD. Thus a shared \textit{inbred} ancestor further increases
the kinship of B and C.

\end{marginfigure}
Multiple inbreeding loops increase the probability that a child
is homozygous by descent at a locus, which can be calculated simply by plugging in $F$, the child's
inbreeding coefficient, into our generalized HW equation.
As one extreme example of the impact of multiple inbreeding loops in
an individual's pedigree, let's consider king Charles II of
Spain, the last of the Spanish Habsburgs.  Charles was the son of
Philip IV of Spain and Mariana of Austria, who were uncle and
niece. If this were the only inbreeding loop, then Charles would have had an
inbreeding coefficient of $\nicefrac{1}{8}$. Unfortunately for Charles, the
Spanish Habsburgs had long kept wealth and power within their family
by arranging marriages between close kin. The pedigree of Charles II is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Carlos_second_pedigree}, and
multiple inbreeding loops are apparent. For example, Phillip III,
Charles II's grandfather and great-grandfather, was himself a child of
an uncle-niece marriage.
\citet{alvarez:09} calculated that Charles II had an inbreeding
coefficient of $0.254$, equivalent to a full-sib mating,
thanks to all of the inbreeding loops in his pedigree. Therefore, he
is expected to have been homozygous by descent for a full quarter of his
genome. As we'll talk about later in these notes, this means that Charles
may have been homozygous for a number of recessive disease alleles,
and indeed he was a very sickly man who left no descendants due to his
infertility. \sidenote[][-2cm]{Pedro Gargantilla, who performed Charles's autopsy, stated
that his body ``did not contain a single drop of blood; his heart was
the size of a peppercorn; his lungs corroded; his intestines rotten
and gangrenous; he had a single testicle, black as coal, and his
head was full of water.'' While some of this description
may refer to actual medical conditions, some of these details seem a
little unlikely. See
\href{https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/03/23/when-charles-ii-of-spain-died-the-autopsy-stated-that-his-body-did-not-contain-a-single-drop-of-blood-and-his-head-was-full-of-water/}{here}.
} Thus plausibly the end of one of the great
European dynasties came about through inbreeding.

\subsection{Calculating inbreeding coefficients from genetic data}
%JRI: you transition from an individual's inbreeding coefficient here to using F as a population inbreeding parameter. i think some text explaining this change of scope might help
If the observed heterozygosity in a population is $H_O$, and we assume that the
generalized Hardy--Weinberg proportions hold, we can set $H_O$ equal to
$f_{12}$, and solve Eq.\ \eqref{eq:hetGenHW} for $F$ to obtain an estimate of
the inbreeding coefficient as
\begin{equation}
\hat{F} = 1-\frac{f_{12}}{2pq} = \frac{2pq - f_{12}}{2pq}.
\label{eqn:Fhat}
\end{equation}
\marginnote{The hat on the F here denotes that this is an estimate
from a sample.}
As before, $p$ is the frequency of allele $A_{1}$ in the population. This can
be rewritten in terms of the observed heterozygosity ($H_O$) and the
heterozygosity expected in the absence of inbreeding, $H_E=2pq$, as
\begin{equation}
\hat{F} = \frac{H_E-H_O}{H_E} = 1 - \frac{H_O}{H_E}.
\label{eqn:FhatHO}
\end{equation}
Hence, $\hat{F}$ quantifies the deviation due to inbreeding of the observed heterozygosity from the one expected under random mating, relative to the latter.
\begin{question}{}
Suppose the following genotype frequencies were observed for an esterase locus in a population of \textit{Drosophila} (A denotes the ``fast" allele and B denotes the ``slow" allele):
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
AA &	AB &	BB\\
\hline
0.6 &	0.2 &	0.2\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
What is the estimate of the inbreeding coefficient at the esterase locus?
\end{question}
If we have multiple loci, we can replace $H_O$ and $H_E$ by their means
over loci, $\bar{H}_O$ and $\bar{H}_E$, respectively. Note that, in principle, we could also calculate $F$ for each individual locus first, and then take the average across loci. However, this procedure is more prone to introducing a bias if sample sizes vary across loci, which is not unlikely when we are dealing with real data.
Genetic markers are commonly used to estimate inbreeding for wild
and/or captive populations of conservation concern. As an example of
this, consider the case of the Mexican wolf ({\it Canis lupus baileyi}), a sub-species of gray wolf. \begin{marginfigure}[-2cm]

\end{marginfigure} They were extirpated in the wild during the mid-1900s due to hunting, and the remaining five Mexican wolves in the wild were captured to start a breeding program. \citet{vonHoldt:11} estimated the current-day, average expected heterozygosity to be $0.18$, based on allele frequencies at over forty thousand SNPs. However, the average Mexican wolf individual was only observed to be heterozygous at $12\%$ of these SNPs. Therefore, the average inbreeding coefficient for the Mexican wolf is $\hat{F} = 1 -\nicefrac{0.12}{0.18}$, i.e. $\sim 33 \%$ of a lobo's genome is homozygous due to recent inbreeding in their pedigree.

\paragraph{Genomic blocks of homozygosity due to inbreeding.}
As we saw above, close relatives are expected to share alleles IBD in
large genomic blocks. Thus, when related individuals mate and transmit
alleles to an inbred offspring, they transmit these alleles in big
blocks through meiosis. As an example, let's return to the case of our
hypothetical first cousins from Figure
\ref{fig:IBD_cousins_chr_cartoon}. If this pair of individuals had a
child, one possible pattern of genetic transmission is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:kid_first_cousins}. The child has inherited the red stretch
of chromosome via two different routes through their predigree from
the grandparents. This is an example of an autozygous
segment, where the child is homozygous by descent at all of the loci in this
red region.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width= 0.75 \textwidth]{figures/sharing_relatives/first_cousin_offspring.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{A pedigree showing the offspring of first cousins. The
chromosomes of their great-grandparents are coloured different colours
so their transmission can be tracked. The child is homozygous by
descent (HBD) for a section of the red chromosome.} \label{fig:kid_first_cousins}
\end{figure}
The inbreeding coefficient of the child sets the proportion of their
genome that will be in these autozygous segments. For example, a child
of first full cousins is expected to have $1/16$ of their
genome in these segments.
The more distant the loop in the pedigree, the more meioses that
chromosomes have been through and the shorter individual blocks will be. A
child of first cousins will have longer blocks than a child of second
cousins, for example.
Individuals with multiple inbreeding loops in their family tree can
have a high inbreeding coefficient due to
the combined effect of many small blocks of autozygosity. For example, Charles II had
an inbreeding coefficient that is equivalent to that of the child of
full-sibs, with a quarter of his genome expected to homozygous by
descent, but this would be made up of many shorter blocks.
%With multiple rounds of inbreeding individuals can
We can hope to detect these blocks by looking for unusually long
genomic runs of homozygosity (ROH) sites in an individual's genome. One way to
estimate an individual's inbreeding coefficient is then to total up
the proportion of an individual's genome that falls in such ROH
regions. This estimate is called $F_{ROH}$.
\graham{update to use figs from G3 Sam's article, and collapse to
single ref.}
An example of using $F_{ROH}$ to study inbreeding comes from the work of
\citet{sams2018fine}, who identified runs of homozygosity in 2,500 dogs,
ranging from 500kb up to many megabases.

\end{figure}
Dog breeds have been subject
to intense breeding that has resulted in high levels of inbreeding. Of the population samples examined, Doberman Pinschers have the highest levels of their genome in runs of
homozygosity ($F_{ROH}$), somewhat higher than English bulldogs. In
\ref{fig:dog_FOH_dist} we can see that English bulldogs have more
short ROH than Doberman Pinschers, but that Doberman Pinschers have
more of their genome in very large ROH ($>16 Mb$). This suggests that
English bulldogs have had long history of inbreeding as they have many
small blocks, but that Doberman Pinschers have a lot of recent
inbreeding as their autozygosity is contained in long blocks
relatively unbroken by recombination.
\begin{ChapterSummary}
\item This chapter developed the relationship between allele
frequencies and genotype frequencies within a generation and among
relatives.
\item Under random mating, we derived expectations of the genotype
frequencies (Hardy-Weinberg), and we can identify deviations away from these
expectations.
\item Identity by descent (IBD) refers to the sharing of alleles due to a
recent shared biological relationship.
\item We can predict the probability and expected level of sharing of
alleles IBD among pairs of relatives using mendelian transmission
probabilities (as contained in coefficients $r_0$, $r_1$, and $r_2$). One useful summary of
relatedness for a pair of individuals is the kinship coefficient
$F_{i,j}$.
\item  We can also learn about genetic relationships from the sharing
of genomic segments among relatives, with many long shared segments revealing a closer relationship.
\item An inbred individual has parents who are more closely related than random draws from some reference population.
\item Inbreeding results in decreased heterozygosity and a complementary increase in homozygosity. We can use the kinship
coefficient of the parents to estimate the distortion away from
Hardy-Weinberg and the expected level of heterozygosity.
\item Inbreeding coefficients can be calculated from genetic data,
either for multiple individuals at a single locus or for multiple loci for
a single individual.

\begin{question}{}
You are studying a codominant flower colour polymorphism. Skipping
through a meadow of flowers you and compile the following data:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
red & pink & white\\
200 & 100 & 200\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
{\bf A)} What frequencies would you expect at this locus under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium? \\
{\bf B)} Calculate the inbreeding coefficient at this locus.\\
{\bf C)} Name two distinct processes that could lead to the deviation
you see, and describe how they would result in a deficit of heterozygotes.

\begin{question}{}
What are the relatedness coefficients of the X chromosome between:\\
{\bf A)} Two male full siblings?\\
{\bf B)} Two female full siblings?\\
{\bf C)} What is the probability that a female offspring of a full sib
mating is homozygous by descent at a locus on her X chromosome?
\end{question}
\begin{question}{}
You are studying the wing spot polymorphism in a butterfly
species. From crosses in the lab you find that the presence of
wing spots is determined by a dominant allele.\\
You collect 100 butterflies, 84 of them have the wing spots. What is
the frequency of the wing-spot allele? What assumption did you have to make to come to your answer?
\end{question}
\begin{question}{}
An allele has frequency of $0.001$ in the population. What is the
probability that both you and your first (full) cousin are heterozygote for
the allele?
\end{question}
\begin{question}{}
The kinship coefficient of the parents is the inbreeding coefficient
of the offspring. Explain, with reference to the weighting of
relatedness coefficients in the inbreeding coefficient, why the
inbreeding coefficient is the probability that a locus is homozygous
by descent.
\end{question}
\begin{question}{}
In terms of identity by descent, explain why multiple
inbreeding loops in an individual's pedigree lead to higher levels of
inbreeding.  \end{question}

#1. Load earthquake data. Use str() and summary()
data(quakes)
?quakes
str(quakes)
summary(quakes)
View(quakes)
?quakes
#2. Show entirety of column "long"
quakes$long
#3. Try function unique() and length(). What unique stations are there?
unique(quakes$stations)
length(quakes$stations)
max(quakes$stations)
#'From "?quakes", I can see that "stations" tells us the number of stations reporting.
#'We cannot tell how many unique stations there are, since some may never have reported.
#'However, from the max() function, we can see that there are at least 132-- since that is the greatest number of
#'stations that reported for any single seismic event.
#4. Use range() to find range of depths where earthquakes occur
range(quakes$depth)
#The range of depth for which earquakes occurred is 40-680 km
#E.C. Where was the earthquake of largest magnitude found?
max(quakes$mag) #max mag=6.4
View(quakes) #sorted by mag=6.4. Found location: lat=-15.56, long=167.62, depth=127 km
