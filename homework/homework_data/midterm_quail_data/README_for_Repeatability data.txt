1) FILE NAME: Repeatability data
File contains morphological measurements (tarsus length, culmen length, bill width, and bill depth) of 123 day old Japanese quail. Measurements were made twice and were used to assess repeatability.  Data were collected by Jacqueline Huard.
Contact for data: Gary Burness

COLUMN HEADINGS:
Bird#: the identity of the individual bird
Culmen: length, in millimetres
Depth: bill depth, in millimetres
Width:bill width, in millimetres
Tarsus: length, in millimetres
Notes: Describes any additional information about a specific individual
Missing data are reported as blanks

Two birds (16 and 18) had deformities and/or bill damage.  



2) FILE NAME: Morphology data

3) FILE NAME: Thermal imaging data
File contains temperatures of different regions of Japanese quail (collected when quail were age between day 120 to 130 post-hatch), at different environmental temperatures.
Data were collected by Glenn Tattersall
Contact for data: Glenn Tattersall or Gary Burness

COLUMN HEADINGS
Bird#: the identity of the individual bird
Sex: m (male) or f (female)
Treatment: 1 or 2; corresponding to rearing environments of 15 or 30 degrees Celsius, respectively
Ambient temp: the temperature of the room (in degrees Celsius).
Bill temperature: estimated temperature of bill
Back feather temperature: estimated temperature of back
Eye temperature: estimated temperature of eye
Notes: Describes any additional information about specific individuals.

All temperature measurements were in degrees Celsius
Individual 32 had a wet bill and was omitted from analysis of bill temperature.
In statistical analysis "Intended ambient temperature" was used as the temperature of the room.
