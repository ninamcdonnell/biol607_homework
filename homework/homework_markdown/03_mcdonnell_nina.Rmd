## 1. Sample Properties

### Consider the following vasopressin levels in voles.

```{r 1a}
vole_vaso <- c(98,96,94,88,86,82,77,74,70,60,
               59,52,50,47,40,35,29,13,6,5)
```

### 1a. Say “Vole vasopressin” 10 times as fast as you can. How many times did you trip up?

Actually, not at all! I am genuinely surprised because usually I don't do well with tongue-twisters!

### 1b. What is the mean, median, sd, and interquartile range of the sample?

```{r 1b}
#use functions to calculate mean, median, SD, and IQR of the vector:
mean(vole_vaso)
median(vole_vaso)
sd(vole_vaso)
IQR(vole_vaso)

```

The mean of the sample is `r mean(vole_vaso)`, the median is `r median(vole_vaso)`, the SD is `r sd(vole_vaso)`, and the IQR is `r IQR (vole_vaso)`.

### 1c. What is the standard error of the mean (do this with a formula!)?

```{r 1c}
#Make a function to calculate SE more easily:
se_mean <- function(x){
  ret_value <- (sd(x))/(sqrt(length(x))) #function will calculate SE of mean based on formula: SD(X)/sqrt(n)
  return(ret_value)
}

se_mean(vole_vaso) #use function to get SE of vole vasopressin sample. SE= 6.65
```

The SE of the mean of the vole vasopressin sample is `r se(vole_vaso)`.

### 1d. What does the standard error of the mean tell you about our estimate of the mean values of the population of vole vassopressin?

The SE of the mean tells us how accurately our sample mean reflects the population mean. For vole vasopressin, most sample means will be within 6.65 units of the population mean.

## 2. Sample Size for upper quartiles.

### We can get the upper quartile value of vole vassopressin with

```{r 2quantile}
quantile(vole_vaso, probs = 0.75)
```
### Let’s assume the sample is representative of the population.

### 2a. Use sample() to get just one resample with a sample size of 10. What is its upper quartile?

```{r 2a}
vole_vaso_sim <- sample(vole_vaso, #resample 10 from vole_vaso with replacement
                        size=10,
                        replace = TRUE) %>% 
  quantile(probs=0.75) #calculate upper quartile of resample values

vole_vaso_sim
```

The upper quantile of the resampled values is `r quantile(vole_vaso_sim, probs = 0.75)`.

### 2b. Build an initial data frame for simulations with the sample sizes 5 through 20.

``` {r 2b}
set.seed(802) #make simulations replicable. Used old area code, 802

boot_vole_vaso <- data.frame(samp_size=5:20) #data frame with sample sizes 5-20

boot_vole_vaso 
```

### 2c. Use this data frame to get simulated upper quartiles at each sample size 1,000 times (i.e., for 1,000 simulations).

``` {r 2c}
boot_vole_vaso2 <- boot_vole_vaso %>% 
  rowwise(samp_size) %>% #calculate across rows/ for each sample
  #simulate vole_vaso data for sample sizes 5-20, 1000 times
  summarize(boot_quantile=replicate(1000, 
                                    quantile(sample(vole_vaso,
                                           size=samp_size,
                                           replace= TRUE), probs=0.75))) #calculate quantile of values from vole_vaso simulation

boot_vole_vaso2
```

### 2d. With a ggplot, make a guesstimate as to the best sample size for estimating the upper quartile of the population. Use whatever geom you feel makes things most easy to see. E.C. Add a red dashed line using geom_vline() or geom_hline() to show where that should be, perhaps.

The range of upper quartile values looks similar after a sample size of 14-15, so this is probably sufficient for estimating the population parameter.

``` {r 2d}
guesstimate <- boot_vole_vaso2 %>% 
  mutate(samp_size_factor=as.factor(samp_size)) %>% #mutate sample size to factor so that boxplots can be made to show variability in quantile values estimated at each sample size.
  ggplot(mapping= aes(x=samp_size_factor, y= boot_quantile))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_vline(xintercept = "15", color= "red")+ #E.C.: add vertical line where x=15, use "" to specify discrete value
  labs(y="upper quartile",
       x="sample size",
       caption="The range of upper quartile values looks similar \n after a sample size of 14-15, so this is probably sufficient for \n estimating the population parameter.")

?caption 

guesstimate
```

### 2e. Plot the SE of the estimate of the upper quantile by sample size. Again, what it the best way to see this? Does it level off? Is there a level you feel acceptable? Justify your answer. Does this match with what you put in 2d?

The SE of the estimated upper quartile levels off around a sample size of 14-15. This concurrs with what we saw in 2d.

```{r 2e}
boot_se_quantile <-boot_vole_vaso2 %>% 
  group_by(samp_size) %>% #grouping SE of the estimate of upper quantile by sample size
  summarise(se_quantile=sd(boot_quantile)) #take standard deviation of the estimated quantile to get SE

se_quant_plot <- ggplot(data=boot_se_quantile, 
                        mapping= aes(x= samp_size, y= se_quantile))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_vline(xintercept= 15, color= "red")+ #E.C.: add vertical line where y=14
  labs(x="sample size",
       y="SE of the estimate of the upper quantile",
       caption="The SE of the estimated upper quartile levels \n off around a sample size of 14-15. This concurrs with what we saw in 2d.")

se_quant_plot
```

## 3. Ggplot

### 3a. Some setup. Run the code below. For extra credit, look up the packages and functions used and explain what is going on here. But, that’s EC.

```{r 3a}
#libraries
library(dplyr)
library(readr) #E.C.: readr is a package that helps to read .csv and other data files
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats) #E.C.: forcats is a package that helps to reorder levels of factor variables

theme_set(theme_bw(base_size=12)) #E.C.: theme_set automatically applies a chosen theme to every plot. Here the theme will be theme_bw, "classic dark-on-light ggplot2 theme." base_size specifies that the default font size will be 11 pt. 

ice <- read_csv("http://biol607.github.io/homework/data/NH_seaice_extent_monthly_1978_2016.csv") %>% #read the .csv data file
  mutate(Month_Name = factor(Month_Name), #change variable month_name to a factor
         Month_Name = fct_reorder(Month_Name, Month)) #E.C. values of Month_Name are reordered so that the values of Month are in ascending order. 
```

### 3b. Make a boxplot showing the variability in sea ice extent every month.

``` {r 3b}

month_extent <- ggplot(data=ice, mapping=aes(x=Month_Name, y=Extent, fill=Month_Name))+
  geom_boxplot()+ #plot ice extent by discrete variable (Month_Name) and color by month
  labs(x="Month",
       y="Sea ice extent 10^6 km^2",
       title="Monthly variability in sea ice extent")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Paired")

month_extent

```

### 3c. Use dplyr to get the annual minimum sea ice extent. Plot minimum ice by year. What do you observe?

I see that the annual minimum sea ice extent has decreased over time between 1978 and 2016.

```{r 3c}
#use dplyr to get annual min ice extent:
min_extent <- ice %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% #group sea ice data by year
  summarize(min_extent=min(Extent)) #for each year, calculate minimum sea ice extent 

str(min_extent) #check output 

#plot min ice by year:
min_extent %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=min_extent, color=min_extent))+
  labs(x="Year",
       y="Minimum ice extent 10^6 km^2",
       title="Annual minimum sea ice extent")+
  geom_point() #make a scatter plot to see the trend over time 

```

### 3d. One thing that’s really cool about faceting is that you can use cut_*() functions on continuos variables to make facets by groups of continuous variables. To see what I mean, try cut_interval(1:10, n = 5) See how it makes five bins of even width? We use cut_interval() or other cut functions with faceting like so facet_wrap(~cut_interval(some_variable)).

### With the original data, plot sea ice by year, with different lines (oh! What geom will you need for that?) for different months. Then, use facet_wrap and cut_interval(Month, n=4) to split the plot into seasons.


```{r 3d}
cut_interval(1:10, n = 5) #testing cut interval

ice %>% 
  #plot extent by year, with a separate line for each month (group)
  ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Extent, group= Month, color=Month))+
  labs(x="Year",
       y="Sea ice extent 10^6 km^2",
       title="Minimum sea ice by year")+
  #use geom_line to visualize trend over time
  geom_line()+
  scale_color_viridis_c(option = "D")+ 
  #facet wrap by season (3 month intervals)
  facet_wrap(~cut_interval(Month, n=4))
  
```

### 3e. Last, make a line plot of sea ice by month with different lines as different years. Gussy it up with colors by year, a different theme, critical values, and whatever other annotations, changes to axes, etc., you think best show the story of this data. For ideas, see the lab, and look at various palettes around. Extra credit for using colorfindr to make a palette.


``` {r 3e}

min(ice$Extent)#find min ice extent, =3.573 in 2012

#plot extent by month, with a separate line for each year (group)
ggice1 <-ggplot(data=ice, mapping=aes(x=Month_Name, y=Extent, group=Year, color=Year))+
  labs(x="Month",
       y="Sea ice extent 10^6 km^2",
       title="Monthly minimum sea ice extent from 1978 to 2016",
       subtitle = "Data from NOAA",
       caption= "lowest ice area in 2012, 3.573 10^6 km^2 (indicated by the red line)")+
  geom_line()+ #use geom_line to visualize trend over time
  geom_hline(yintercept= min(ice$Extent), color= "red")+ #add line to show lowest extent value
  scale_color_gradient(low="gray", high="blue")+ #color as a gradient of years
  theme_clean()

ggice1

```

### Extra credit: tried colorfindr

This plot is probably not as helpful as the one above because year is not color-coded as a continuous variable and it is hard to see which year is which. However, it does match the colors of the melting ice.  

Inspiration from national geographic:

```{r EC colorfindr}

#Extra credit: try colorfindr
library(colorfindr)

#Find top 100 colors from NatGeo melting ice picture
last_ice <- get_colors("https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/environment/2018/12/book_glaciers/01_book_glacier_h_12_7_00010056.ngsversion.1545405649508.adapt.1900.1.jpg", 
                       top_n = 100, exclude_col ="white") #exclude white from list of colors
last_ice_pallette <- last_ice$col_hex #make an object from a vector of colors to serve as color values in plot

ice2 <- ice %>% 
  mutate(year_factor=as.factor(Year)) #mutate year to factor so that palette can color it as discrete
  
#plot extent by month, with a separate line for each year (group)
ggice_colorfindr <-ggplot(data=ice2, mapping=aes(x=Month_Name, y=Extent, group=Year, color=year_factor))+ #using year as a factor for color
  labs(x="Month",
       y="Sea ice extent 10^6 km^2",
       title="Monthly minimum sea ice extent from 1978 to 2016",
      subtitle = "Data from NOAA",
       legend="Year")+
  geom_line()+
  labs(color="Year") + #relabel legend from "year_factor"
  scale_color_manual(values = last_ice_pallette[30:69])+ #color with NatGeo ice colors, selecting 39 values for the 39 years
  theme_clean()

ggice_colorfindr
  
```

### Extra credit: tried animation

```{r EC animate}
ggice_animate <-ggplot(data=ice2, mapping=aes(x=Month_Name, y=Extent, group=Year, color=Year))+
  labs(x="Month",
       y="Sea ice extent 10^6 km^2",
        subtitle = "Data from NOAA",
       title="Monthly minimum sea ice extent from 1978 to 2016")+
  geom_line()+
  scale_color_gradient(low="gray", high="blue")+
  theme_clean()+
  transition_reveal(Year) + #reveal years with each frame
  ease_aes("linear")
  
animate(ggice_animate)
```
